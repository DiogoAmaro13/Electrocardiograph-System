Real-time monitoring and alert system to detect abnormal variations in cardiac signals

In recent times, mechanisms for interpreting vital signs have been playing an increasingly crucial role in monitoring and controlling a patientâ€™s medical condition, as they allow for the real-time detection of sudden and/or abnormal changes in certain physiological parameters. However, despite being effective, some of these analysis methods lack certain functional parameters, such as automatic alert systems and/or rudimentary interfaces, which can delay the readiness to respond to a physiological change.

Thus, this project aims to develop a real-time monitoring and alert system for the cardiac signal capable of quickly detecting an abnormal variation in it. To this end, an Arduino board was integrated as the main source for detecting and interpreting the cardiac signal, along with LabVIEW which provides the visual component of the project.
